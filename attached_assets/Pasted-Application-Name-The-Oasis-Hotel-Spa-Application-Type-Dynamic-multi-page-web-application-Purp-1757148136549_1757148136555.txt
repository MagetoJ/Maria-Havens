Application Name: The Oasis Hotel & Spa

Application Type: Dynamic, multi-page web application

Purpose: To create a modern, dynamic, and fully functional website for a hotel. The site will serve as a comprehensive online brochure and a powerful booking engine, allowing guests to explore rooms and amenities, check real-time availability, and securely book their stay.

Core Functionality
Home Page: An inviting and visually appealing landing page featuring a full-width hero image or video. It should highlight the hotel's key features, showcase a few select rooms, and include a clear call-to-action for the booking engine.

Rooms & Suites: A dedicated page to showcase all room types. Each room should have its own section with high-quality images, a detailed description, a list of in-room amenities, and pricing information.

Amenities: A gallery-style page detailing all the hotel's amenities, such as the restaurant, spa, pool, fitness center, and event spaces.

Booking Engine: The core of the website. This feature will allow guests to:

Select check-in and check-out dates.

Specify the number of adults and children.

View a list of available rooms based on their search criteria.

See real-time pricing and room details.

Complete a secure booking process.

Gallery: A section showcasing professional photos of the hotel's interiors, exteriors, and surrounding area.

Contact: A page with hotel contact information, a map, and a contact form for general inquiries.

Technical Stack
Frontend: React for building the dynamic user interface, Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern design, and standard JavaScript.

Backend: Django to handle business logic, data management, and API endpoints.

Database: PostgreSQL for a robust and reliable database solution.

Communication: All communication between the frontend and backend will be handled via API endpoints using the fetch API.
